Release Notes
=============

This document collects changes on a release to release base. For open known issues, please refer to
the bug database on SourceForge. 

Version 1.1.0
-------------

This version includes all the changes necessary for the submission of Vincent to the
OpenGL ES conformance procedure. Here are the details for the submitted configuration:

Vincent OpenGL ES 1.1 Common Lite
---------------------------------

CPUs:		ARMv4

OS:		Windows Mobile 2003

API pipeline:	GL_VENDOR       "Hans-Martin Will"
		GL_RENDERER	"Software"
		GL_VERSION	"OpenGL ES-CL 1.1 Software JIT"
			
Display configuration:  48 x 48, 16bpp

As a note, even though Vincent implements the API defined by the common profile, it
is not implemented using floating point arithmetic, but rather converts floats to
fixed values through a compatibility layer. In external executions, the library
still passes all but one test for the common profile: The test that verifies 
retrieval of state variables. This test fails due to loss of precision due to internal storage
of certain parameters as fixed vs. floating point values.


Version 0.99
------------

Purpose of this release is preparation of the submission of the conformance test results for Vincent.

This version addresses the following issues:

1008789 - Enhanced texture processing according to OpenGL 1.5 spec.
1284482 - User Clip Plane test failed
1284483 - Buffer Objects test failed
1284484 - Matrix Query test failed
1284485 - Must Pass test failed
1378544 - Horizontal and Vertical Line test failed.


Version 0.84
------------

This is a build to address the pointer problem listed below. It has *not* been fully regression tested 
against the conformance test suite, even though it is expected to be mostly stable. If you have any problems,
please revert to version 0.83.

This version addresses the following issues:

1207580 - Freeing invalid pointer
1209681 - Derivatives for mipmap selection swapped


Version 0.83
------------

For XScale builds, the Intel Graphics Performance Primitives are no longer needed by default. If you
want to use this library, simply define the constant EGL_USE_GPP in your compiler options.

OGLES.h now contains several configuration parameters that allow for fine-tuning the behavior of the
library being built. See also README.txt for updated information.

This version addresses the following issues:

1030170 - Support more than one texture unit
1008793 - Static and Dynamic state queries
1031202 - Bitmap handle leak
1031201 - Device context leak
1028995 - Clip planes cannot be disabled
1001371 - Use CLZ for XScale and retire GPP
1033799 - Under-/overflow in fog calculation
1034326 - use CLZ in emit_unary_log2 for XScale builds
1034149 - Addressing mode for min/max operations
1001373 - optimize register allocation


Version 0.82
------------

Version 0.82 is again a significant milestone build for Vincent. It incorporates the following enhancements:

0.) In addition to the common lite profile, the library has been tested against the OpenGL ES 1.0
    conformance test for the Common profile. For this reason, the suffix of the library has been
    changed from _CL to _CM. In addition, the naming conventions for the library file names have
    been accommodated for, which means that now the library file is called libGLES_CM.dll.
 
1.) For ARM, all rasterization code is now generated using the JIT, including points and lines

2.) A first series of performance enhancements has been included

3.) In preparation for the OpenGL ES Coding Challenge, a series of new features from the OpenGL ES 1.1 API
    specification have been added:
    
    - Point sprites and point size arrays
    - Automatic mipmap generation as core functionality
    - Buffer objects
    - Vertex skinning
    - User-defined clip planes
    
Please note that the conformance test suite for OpenGL ES 1.1 has not been released yet, which means that
these new features have not undergone the kind of testing that all previous features have. However, the
library is fully regression tested against the 1.0 conformance test suite.

The following areas from the 1.1 specification have not been addressed yet:

1.) Improved texture functionality including the availability of at least 2 texture units.
2.) Full support for static and dynamic state queries.

This version addresses the following issues:

 960546 - Validate all error conditions for all gl... entry points
 970894 - glDrawArrays/glDrawElements should validate arrays
1010509 - specular exponent in material not initialized
1010508 - EGL_Power on x86 buggy
1010510 - specular color incorrect
1010824 - Provide utility function to save screenshots
1011519 - Improve rasterizer state comparisons
1001369 - Convert point rasterization to JIT
1011035 - Convert line rasterization to JIT
1001370 - fixed functions
1014020 - Fog Linear test failed.
1014019 - Blend test failed.
1014018 - LogicOp Function test failed.
1014016 - Stencil Plane Operation test failed.
1014017 - Stencil Plane Function test failed.
1015029 - Linear fog efficiency
1008788	- Auto mipmap generation
1008786 - Buffer Objects
1012401 - Optimize SelectArrayElement
1008792 - Enhanced point sprites and point sprite arrays
1008791 - User-defined clip planes
1025167 - glColorPointer with byte coordinates
1008790 - Vertex skinning functionality


Version 0.81
------------

This version adds the redbook examples that are distributed with the reference implementation. To
do so, a version of the ug library (the mini GLUT included in the reference implementation) has
been added.

In addition, a couple of defects that showed up in those examples have been addressed:

 863654 - Create specialized pipeline functions for geometry stage 
 960543 - BindTexture should record an error for invalid targets
1001348 - By default, smooth shading should be enabled
1001352 - movelight example is rendered incorrectly
1001351 - alpha3d example does not render correctly
1001354 - Stray red pixels in examples
1001356 - Polyoff example shows stippling
1008798 - Clipping issue invovling points at infinity
1001825 - Mesh created by ugWireSphere/ugSolidSphere is iffy
1001882	- eglGetError return value


Version 0.80
------------

This version constitutes a major milestone for Vincent. First of all, Vincent has become
feature complete and can pass the full OpenGL ES conformance test in internal runs. From this
point on, all releases of Vincent will be fully regression tested against the conformance
test.

Second, first steps towards support for Symbian has been added; specifically support for implementations
of Nokia's Series 60 platform. The implementations is not fully working yet, but at least will compile
without errors. If you are interested in completing this port, please contact the project administrator.

This version addresses the following issues:

980877 - Mipmaps Selection test failed.
980878 - Mipmaps Interpolation test failed.
996378 - Color buffer is effectively 16-bit
996379 - Trap exceptions when context not set.
997772 - compressed NULL texture fails.

Notes:

1.) Even though this build passes the mipmap interpolation test from the conformance test, tri-linear
mipmapping is still not implemented yet. This should become available soon.

2.) Users of previous builds of this library will notice a substantial reduction in performance (~15%)
compared to previous builds when using mipmapping. This is due to the fact that the current build will
perform mipmap selection on a per-pixel base; more precisely, per linearly interpolated sub-span of
each scan line. The plan is to introduce several configurations, which will be either fully-conformant
but slower, or not fully conformant but faster.

3.) While the current build passes the conformance test, the current build still uses different
rendering paths for point and line rasterization (non-JIT) than for triangle rasterization (JIT). The
upcoming series of builds will convert point and line rasterization to use the JIT. Besides increased
performance especially for rendering lines the most significant gain will be a reliable assessment of
the correctness of this implementation by using a single path for all raster operations.


Version 0.79
------------

This build features a new rasterizer for triangles. Most notably, the new rasterizer fully
implements the plane equation approach with pixel and texel correct stepping of all
parameters.

To fully pass the conformance test, the base internal format for RGBA textures has been changed from
RGBA5551 to RGBA8888. The base internal format can easily be set to the other supported formats by
changing the return value of TextureFormatFromEnum in ContextTexture.cpp.

The remaining issues with the conformance test are regardng mipmap selection and mipmap interpolation.
Currently, Vincent uses mipmap selection on a per-triangle base as is common for most rasterizers.
For those two remaining tests, mipmap selection will have to be done on a per-pixel base based
on the current texture gradients. The plan is to create two EGL Config entries, one marked as
slow (but conformant and using per pixel mipmap selection), the other being marked as non-conformant 
(and using per-triangle mip mapping).

This version addresses the following issues:

961343 - Use DDA for triangle edges
970915 - Matrix Stack test failed
980874 - Texture Edge Clamp test failed.
970910 - Triangle Tile test failed.
980879 - Packed Pixels test failed.
980882 - Copy Texture test failed. For this issue, there still needs to be a clarification 
	 from the review board concerning the minimum bit depth required for textures.
980876 - Compressed Paletted Texture test failed.	 
987381 - Line clipper bug.


Version 0.78
------------

This build addresses all known failures of the conformance test that are not related to
texture sampling. Notably, it passes the lightning, fog and blending tests.

This version addresses the following issues:

970897 - Vertex Order test (Test number #5) failed.
970910 - Triangle Tile test failed
970911 - Spotlight tests failed
970912 - Blend test failed.
970913 - Fog Linear test failed.
970916 - Transformation Normal test failed.

958793 - Create math library for non-XScale processors
937679 - Employ plane equations for rasterization

In addition, this version addresses the following issues:

958787 - GL_OES_query_matrix extension missing
951114 - glLineWidth causes freeze
958791 - eglCopyBuffers not implemented
958797 - eglGetProcAddress not implemented
958790 - Pixmap rendering surface not implemented


Version 0.75 (beta)
-------------------

Vincent goes finally beta. The library is becoming sufficiently stable that I feel
comfortable to advertise it to a larger user base. In addition, Vincent successfuly
runs on Pocket PCs having StrongARM processors and Smartphones using TI OMAP processors.

For the next point release, the plan is to rework the rasterizer to employ more of the
ideas outlined in Hecker's artcile series on software rasterization (see link on web site).
Also, now that a sufficiently sized set of regression tests is passed, I can finally
address the overall performance issues that the library has. Especially the JIT has
a huge performance potential once instruction re-ordering (both IR and on machine code 
level) get incorporated. I just did not want to re-order instructions unless in-order
execution was correct.

I have been using the core parts of the OpenGL ES test suite to ensure a controlled level
of quality for this release. I am excercising only the fixed point API as part of these
tests. Note that these are internal runs executed on a Pocket PC with XScale porocessor. 
There has not been an official submission of any tests results yet, and I do not claim
any level of compliance with the OpenGL ES 1.0 API specification.
