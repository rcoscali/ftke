 *  which is moved by a modeling transformation (rotate or
 *  translate).  The light position is reset after the modeling
 *  transformation is called.  The eye position does not change.
 *
 *  A sphere is drawn using a grey material characteristic.
 *  A single light source illuminates the object.
 *
 *  Interaction:  pressing the left mouse button alters
 *  the modeling transformation (x rotation) by 30 degrees.
