 *  YYYY = four-digit year
 *  MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
 *  DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
 *  hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)

 *
 * This profile defines two ways of handling time zone offsets:
 *      - Times are expressed in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time),
 *      with a special UTC designator ("Z").
 *
 *      - Times are expressed in local time, together with a time zone offset
 *      in hours and minutes. A time zone offset of "+hh:mm" indicates that
 *      the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm"
 *      minutes ahead of UTC. A time zone offset of "-hh:mm" indicates that
 *      the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm"
 *      minutes behind UTC.
 *
 * For example:
 * 1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00 corresponds to November 5, 1994, 8:15:30 am,
 * US Eastern Standard Time.
 * 1994-11-05T13:15:30Z corresponds to the same instant.
