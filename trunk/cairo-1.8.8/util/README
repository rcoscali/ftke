Cairo Utilities
===============

There are a varieties of utilities we use with cairo.


backtrace-symbols
-----------------

This is a small shared library designed to be preloaded by the
linker and its purpose is to make the backtrace_symbols() function
of glibc produce more useful source reference information.

Build by:

	make backtrace-symbols.so

and use by:

	LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/backtrace-symbols.so app-to-run

This code should be contributed back to glibc at some point.


malloc-stats
------------

This is a small shared library designed to be preloaded by the
linker and its purpose is to make the malloc_stats() function
of glibc produce more useful information.

Build by:

	make malloc-stats.so

and use by:

	LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/malloc-stats.so app-to-run

This works best when backtrace-symbols is in use.  That is:

	LD_PRELOAD="$PWD/backtrace-symbols.so $PWD/malloc-stats.so" app-to-run


cairo-trace
-----------

This tool can be used to trace all the cairo function calls made by an
applications.  This is useful for either extracting a test case triggering
a bug from an application, or simply to get a general idea of how an
application is using cairo.

This tool lives outside the cairo source distribution right now and can
be found in a git repository at:

	http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~ickle/cairo-trace/

There are plans to move it to this directory in the future, and possibly
install it on the system.


cairo-api-update and xr2cairo
-----------------------------

These two scripts were used to convert source code written for pre-1.0
cairo to newer API.  See $(top_srcdir)/PORTING_GUIDE for more information.

These files are obsolete now and may be removed in a future version.
